# Bayt - An all in one shared housing app

### What and why?

When living in shared accomodations, it becomes difficult to delegate house chores, decide grocery options, and split finances for shares household purchases. Purchases such as that mop you might've bought for everybody to clean the residence or that air fryer you bought and decided to split the payment for. With the IOS app Bayt, you can view who's purchased what, and decide how payment should be handled such as one roommate buying the toilet paper next time or just paying outright cash. You should also be able to generate grocery lists that just make sense, based off meal preferences and dietary restrictions of your roommates. Another important feature is to draft living agreements that arent 200 lines long and straight to the point. In summary, Bayt should make living with people much easier by tackling those common issues across roommates.

### For whom?

The main users would be students in dormitories, families that work together to take care of their home, or anyone that has shared accomodation. This might also be useful for property managers to manage shared housing when it comes to agreements and disputes.

### How?

This is quite similar to the what and why response, but these are some feature ideas that will help get an understanding of what the app might have: 

Features:
- Grocery lists
- Payment management
- Chore management
- Living Agreements and disputes
- Maintenence schedules
- Managing leases of residents

### Scope
If the project is finished earlier than expected, we can begin to integrate property management features to make it easier for landlords to manage these living sitations and properties. However, i think its more than doable to write the backend for this app and create the mobile interface using ReactJS and ExpressJS for this semester.
